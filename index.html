        <h1>this is not a book about fonts. It is a book about how to use them.
          Typefaces are an essential resource employed by graphic designers, just as
          glass, stone, steel, and other materials are employed by architects. Graphic
          designers sometimes create their own typefaces and custom lettering. More
          commonly, however, they tap the vast library of existing typefaces, choosing
          and combining them in response to a particular audience or situation. To
          do this with wit and wisdom requires knowledge of how—and why—
          letterforms have evolved.<br></br>
          Words originated as gestures of the body. The first typefaces were directly
          modeled on the forms of calligraphy. Typefaces, however, are not bodily
          gestures—they are manufactured images designed for infinite repetition.
          The history of typography reflects a continual tension between the hand and
          the machine, the organic and the geometric, the human body and the
          abstract system. These tensions, which marked the birth of printed letters
          over five hundred year ago, continue to energize typography today.<br></br>
          Movable type, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the early
          fifteenth century, revolutionized writing in the West. Whereas scribes had
          previously manufactured books and documents by hand, printing with type
          allowed for mass production: large quantities of letters could be cast from a
          mold and assembled into “forms.” After the pages were proofed, corrected,
          and printed, the letters were put away in gridded cases for reuse.<br></br>
          Movable type had been employed earlier in China but had proven less
          useful there. Whereas the Chinese writing system contains tens of
          thousands of distinct characters, the Latin alphabet translates the sounds of
          speech into a small set of marks, making it well-suited to mechanization.
          Gutenberg’s famous Bible took the handmade manuscript as its model.
          Emulating the dense, dark handwriting known as “blackletter,” he
          reproduced its erratic texture by creating variations of each letter as well
          as numerous ligatures (characters that combine two or more letters into
          a single form).
