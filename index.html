        <h1>this is not a book about fonts. It is a book about how to use them.
          Typefaces are an essential resource employed by graphic designers, just as
          glass, stone, steel, and other materials are employed by architects. Graphic
          designers sometimes create their own typefaces and custom lettering. More
          commonly, however, they tap the vast library of existing typefaces, choosing
          and combining them in response to a particular audience or situation. To
          do this with wit and wisdom requires knowledge of how—and why—
          letterforms have evolved.<br></br>
          Words originated as gestures of the body. The first typefaces were directly
          modeled on the forms of calligraphy. Typefaces, however, are not bodily
          gestures—they are manufactured images designed for infinite repetition.
          The history of typography reflects a continual tension between the hand and
          the machine, the organic and the geometric, the human body and the
          abstract system. These tensions, which marked the birth of printed letters
          over five hundred year ago, continue to energize typography today.<br></br>
          Movable type, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the early
          fifteenth century, revolutionized writing in the West. Whereas scribes had
          previously manufactured books and documents by hand, printing with type
          allowed for mass production: large quantities of letters could be cast from a
          mold and assembled into “forms.” After the pages were proofed, corrected,
          and printed, the letters were put away in gridded cases for reuse.<br></br>
          Movable type had been employed earlier in China but had proven less
          useful there. Whereas the Chinese writing system contains tens of
          thousands of distinct characters, the Latin alphabet translates the sounds of
          speech into a small set of marks, making it well-suited to mechanization.
          Gutenberg’s famous Bible took the handmade manuscript as its model.
          Emulating the dense, dark handwriting known as “blackletter,” he
          reproduced its erratic texture by creating variations of each letter as well
          as numerous ligatures (characters that combine two or more letters into
          a single form).

            <h3>While it may seem like standard theories about color have always existed, that’s not the case. Of course, colors like blue have been around since ancient times, when the Egyptians learned how to create permanent pigments from minerals. Even Leonardo da Vinci explored color principles in his extensive notebooks. However, it wasn’t until the 18th century that color theory began to formally take shape.
              <br></br>
              Initial explorations in color were from a scientific point of view. Isaac Newton, in his 1704 book Opticks made a breakthrough in proving that light was made of different colors. Controversial at the time—as it was thought that pure light was colorless—his experiments became important stepping stones for color theory. He even organized an early color wheel based off of the color combinations he saw when refracting light waves through a prism.
              <br></br>
              Later publications, The Theory of Colours by German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast by French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul, are considered the founding documents of color theory. Published in the early 19th century, they deal with color psychology and chromatic aberration, and they further refined the color wheel.
              <br></br>
              At that time, color theory was based on RYB primary colors, which defined <a href="https://www.google.com/"><span class="highlight">red, yellow, and blue</span> </a> as the colors capable of mixing all hues. This is the scheme most commonly taught in grade school and is still used in mixing paints. Later scholars would switch to an RGB (red, green, blue) and CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) models as advances in technology increased the range of synthetic pigments in photography and printers.

          <h3>The archetypal object-oriented programming language is Smalltalk, created by a coterie of geniuses at Xerox PARC during that institution’s most glorious of glory days. After years of gestation, Smalltalk was born in 1972, the same year as C, and gelled around 1980. It was inspired by many of the big ideas in computer science, but also by Platonism, by cell biology, and by a predecessor language called Simula, the first object-oriented language, which per its name was designed to … simulate things. While C was created within the New Jersey research facilities (Bell Labs) of an industrial monolith (AT&T) to solve problems at hand, Smalltalk was built at the far-off California outpost of a different industrial monolith, Xerox, to solve the problems of the distant future. Thus Smalltalk represents the world differently than C.

            <h3>Smalltalk has a funny name and a friendly attitude, but its specification ran to 700 pages. It was a big system. C gave you an abstraction over the entire computer, helping you manage memory and processes inside the machine. Smalltalk gave you an abstraction over all of reality, so you could start dividing the world into classes and methods and the like. Where C tried to make it easier to do computer things, Smalltalk tried to make it easier to do human things.
